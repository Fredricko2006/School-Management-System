# School Management System — Data Structures in Action

This repository contains a prototype School Management System built for the
Data Structures and Algorithms course. It demonstrates practical use of
multiple data structures to manage students, course scheduling, fees,
library records, and performance analytics.

## Modules and Data Structures
- Student Registry — HashMap
- Course Scheduling — Queue
- Fee Tracking — Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Library System — HashMap + Stack
- Performance Analytics — Heap + Matrix

Each module is implemented in Java and includes comments explaining logic.
